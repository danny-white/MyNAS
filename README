currently adds file with name Hello.txt, content "Hello World!"
then uploads it, change to upload a file from command line arg.
first use cron of some kind to check the thunderbird data folder
process flow is on trigger from folder from thunderbird, the email asking for a file has been recieved
on that, call drive.py with the file as a command line arg,
then delete the email

second portion is another cron job, on a new file addition which will create a non-null diff, take ls -R to a file
and then upload that to "files.txt" in the drive folder, or something like that.

That ought to be that!





crontab should read:

*/N * * * * ./main.sh > /dev/null

where N is minutes between run


drive.py does not get refresh tokens and thus times out. Change to store refresho tokens

besides that and authorization, everything else should work!
