currently adds file with name Hello.txt, content "Hello World!"
then uploads it, change to upload a file from command line arg.
first use cron of some kind to check the thunderbird data folder
process flow is on trigger from folder from thunderbird, the email asking for a file has been recieved
on that, call drive.py with the file as a command line arg,
then delete the email

second portion is another cron job, on a new file addition which will create a non-null diff, take ls -R to a file
and then upload that to "files.txt" in the drive folder, or something like that.

That ought to be that!


Mail is in, but refresh might not work, who knows


crontab should read:

*/10 * * * * python mail.py > /dev/null


./main.sh 
works as intended, need to make sure refreshing works. Progress!!
